# Creative and Computational Methods for Working with Digital Footprint Data

## Introduction

Our social interactions, personal behaviour and commercial transactions are now increasingly conducted online and/ or captured digitally. These digital phenomena are often aggregated into large, rich and unstructured data sets, many of which are only accessible if you possess the right computational skills to access and manage data from websites and online databases (Kitchin, 2014).  

This three-day online course introduces researchers to computational methods for generating and collecting digital data.

It is most suited to empirical researchers in the arts, humanities and social sciences.

## Course materials

This repository houses the materials underpinning a three-day Spring into Methods training course lead by [Dr Diarmuid McDonnell](https://www.uws.ac.uk/staff-directory/diarmuid-mcdonnell/), University of the West of Scotland. The course was first run 16-18 May 2022.

### Programme

The course programme can be viewed [here](https://github.com/DiarmuidM/creative-and-computational-methods-for-digital-data/sim-programme-v2-2022-05-13.pdf).

### Materials

The training materials can be found in the following folders:
* [code](./code) - Jupyter Notebooks containing executable Python code for the web-scraping/API lessons.
* [data-challenges](./data-challenges) - a series of web-scraping / API challenges and exercises for day three.
* [presentations](./presentations) - PDF versions of the course lectures.
* [resources](./resources) - lists of interesting and relevant learning resources.
