# Python code

We have developed a number of Jupyter notebooks &mdash; electronic documents that can also execute programming code &mdash; to help you learn to use web-scraping and APIs.

You can download these notebooks to your own machine but, for learning purposes, it is easier to just launch them in your browser &mdash; click on the button below. Using the notebooks this way means you do not need to install any software on your machine. Once the online service (Binder) has launched, click on the notebook you want to run. (*Don't worry if takes up to a minute to launch*)

If you want to follow the course programme, then here is the order to work through the notebooks:
