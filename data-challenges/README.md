# Creative and Computational Methods for Working with Digital Footprint Data

## Data Challenges

For your final day, please choose one of the following challenges to complete. Solutions for challenges 1 and 2 can be found here: [TBA].

### Challenge 1 - Desert Island Discs

Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 show that interviews persons of interest about the lives, with a particular focus on the music and items that would accompany them if they were stuck on a desert island. Your colleague, who is a cultural sociologist, has asked you to collect summary information for the most recent set of episodes:
* Scrape data for the most recent episode [Beginner]
* Scrape data for the ten most recent episodes [Intermediate]
* Create a list of all of the episodes available on the website [Advanced]

### Challenge 2 - Free Play

Choose a website / API that you are interested and write a simple script that collects data from it.

### Challenge 3 - Course Exercises

If you did not manage to complete them during day two, then try and finish the web-scraping and API exercises contained in the [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/DiarmuidM/creative-and-computational-methods-for-digital-data/tree/main/code).
